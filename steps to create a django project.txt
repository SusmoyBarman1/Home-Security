1. Create a django project
-> django-admin startproject project_name

2. Start app -> python manage.py startapp app_name

3. add the app name in 'settings.py'

4. add url in 'urls.py'

5. add function in 'views.py'

6. To add static files, first copy the html files in 'templates' folder and copy the static files like js, css in static folder.
and then write this on settings.py:

STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'assets')

add this command in the top of every html file: {% load static %}

then write a command in cmd: python manage.py collectstatic 

This will autometically create a folder callded 'assets' and copy all static files into it. But till this point, the html file can not load the static files. To load the static files in html file, we need to put all 'href' and 'src' into:
{% static 'href' %}.

7. Connector between django and postgresql is: psycopg2 (pip install ..)

8. add the colums, we have to migrate: python manage.py makemigrations

Then create a table: python manage.py sqlmigrate mysite 0001

And then, add your table with database: python manage.py migrate

9. Create super user: python manage.py createsuperuser

10. To work with data in database, we have to set the media section. in settings.py file, we have to add:

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

and in project/urls.py (not app/urls.py) we have to added:

from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = urlpatterns + static(settings.MEDIA_URL,      document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

and to fetch data from database, we need to write in app.vies.py:

variable = Dbname.objects.all()
